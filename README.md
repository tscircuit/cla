## Why do we have a CLA?

We need to abide by copyright law. When you make a contribution you "own it" by default. The `LICENSE` file on a repository sets
the terms for how your contribution can be used. For private repositories or specially-licensed projects, we need to make sure
that the "guardian" (tscircuit) is able to relicense or use flexibly for the success of the company.

If you have not been asked to sign a CLA, you don't need to. We ask people to sign the CLA when

There are no exceptions to the CLA rule for private contributions. Future investors of tscircuit _will_ check that every contribution
to tscircuit is safe from copyright liabilities.

## What is inside the CLA?

The CLA is short and easily readable. As a high level summary (IN NO WAY MEANT TO MEANINGFULLY REPRESENT THE CONTENTS OF THE LICENSE) it
says that tscircuit can do whatever it wants with your contributions. It also establishes that compensation is separate. If you contribute
something then tscircuit gets it, even if for whatever reason you're not compensated.

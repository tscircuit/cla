Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to tscircuit and to recipients of software distributed by tscircuit a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

### 3. Patent License

You hereby grant to tscircuit and to recipients of software distributed by tscircuit a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contributions with the Work to which such Contributions were submitted.

### 4. Moral Rights and Waiver

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You waive any and all moral rights in Your Contributions. If such waiver is not permitted by law, You agree not to assert such rights against tscircuit or its licensees.

### 7. No Compensation

You understand and agree that You are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement for any Contributions unless otherwise agreed in writing by tscircuit. This Agreement does not preclude separate commercial or employment agreements with tscircuit that may govern compensation or terms of work.

### 8. Representations

You represent that:

- Each Contribution is an original creation authored by You and that You have the right to grant the rights set forth in this Agreement.
- You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
- If You are making a Contribution in the course of work done for an employer or another entity (e.g., as a contractor), You represent that such employer or entity has authorized You to make the Contribution and has waived or assigned all rights necessary to fulfill this Agreement.
